## Explain

**CVE-2019-8331 is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) type security vulnerability found in Bootstrap, a JavaScript library widely used in developing websites and mobile applications. This vulnerability occurs because Bootstrap does not properly filter data submitted to the data-template attribute of a tooltip or popover element, allowing an attacker to insert malicious code into web pages.**

**This attack can occur if an attacker can control the data displayed as a tooltip or popover. When a user enables Tooltip or Popover, malicious code is inserted into a web page and may be triggered by the user's browser.**

**This vulnerability has been fixed in Bootstrap versions 4.3.1 and 5.0.0-beta2.**
